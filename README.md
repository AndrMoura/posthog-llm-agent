# PostHog-LLM 

PostHog-LLM is an extended version of PostHog to work with text analytics and LLM applications. We integrated machine learning models during data ingestion that extract text features from your LLM interactions and we also introduce the ability to visualize your LLM interactions in the insights page!

Head over to our [GitHub](https://github.com/postlang/posthog-llm) to quickly deploy your instance locally.


Once your instance is up and running, check out the notebook that demonstrates a simple example of interacting with a chat model and sending the interactions to PostHog-LLM for analysis.
